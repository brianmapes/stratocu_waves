# stratocu_waves
Seeking to isolate wave modulation of low cloud field brightness and cellular evolution processes. 

I will try to use OpenPIV http://www.openpiv.net/ to estimate and subtract remove the advected cellular structure (most of the variance).

conda create -n scwaves -c conda-forge jupyterlab openpiv pandas
